            // Java provides a bunch of math operators to manipulate values. The value on either side of the operator is called the operand
            // Java's math operators:
                // + addition (4 + 3 = 7)
                // - subtraction (4 - 3 = 1)
                // * multiplication (4 * 3 = 12)
                // / division (4 / 3 = 1.333)
                // % modulo (4 % 3 = 1) (returns the remainder of a division)

            // All operations with math operators can be preformed on constants and variables (50 + 50, 43 + sum1, sum1 + sum2)

            // Note: When storing the product of a division in an int, you'll get a whole number instead of a decimal. I don't know if Java rounds or truncates,
            // but either way you won't get the exact value of the division unless you store it in a double
