Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and is used to make things like Android apps, banking backends, regular programs, web apps
and more!

Java's slogan is "Write once, run everywhere", meaning Java is meant to be run on different platforms regardless of what they are

Here's a first look into Java programming:
    System.out.println("Hello, Java!");


Statements
    A statement is a single line of code that preforms a specific task. The code above that prints "Hello, Java!" is a statement. Each statements must be ended
    with a semicolon

    When printing with System.out.println, text must be wrapped in quotes, but numbers don't. The thing to output must still be in the parentheses though
