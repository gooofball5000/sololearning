        // Variables
            // Variables store data, and have specific types which denote what TYPE of data they store
            // Variables have types such as:
                // int - Stores whole numbers, both positive and negative (ex 159)
                // double - Stores floating-point / real numbers (ex 3.235)
                // String - Stores text, must be enclosed in quotes (ex "Hello!")

            // Variables can be declared and defined at the same time, for example:
        String name = "David";

            // Important note: A variable with a type can only store that type. Putting a string into an int doesn't work

            // More variable examples:
        String name2 = "John";
        int age = 42;
        double score = 15.9;
        char group = 'z';

            // char stands for character, and holds a single character (duh)
            // Another type of variable is a boolean, which only stores true or false values

        boolean online = false;

            // You can also use a CSL (comma seperated list) to declare variables
        int a = 2, int b = 41;
